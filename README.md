# Visualization-Project-3

In this Project we are visualizing the protein interaction network

## Weekly Meeting Progress(11/21/2016)

Vibhuti Gupta: Performed Research on the Protein and cBioportal to get the information to display on the network.

Kiran: Worked on web API to get an idea for api request and response

Akash: Worked on use cases

## Next week Meeting Tasks(11/28/2016)

Vibhuti Gupta: Work on visualizing scatter plot of some of the intresting information such as male and female ratio fetched from cBioPortal for each protein on all cancer studies

Kiran: Work on fetching data using web API.

Akash: Find and display images for the different types of cancers associated with the protein. 

We have worked on fetching the male and female ratio for each cancer study in cbioportal and visualize it in a form of scatter plot. Initial phase of fetching the data is being done.

## Next week Meeting Tasks(12/05/2016)

Vibhuti Gupta: Work on the drop down for all cancer studies and visualizing the network of 10 most important genes studied in that.

Kiran: Visualize the scatter plot for some parameters on selecting the study from the drop down.
